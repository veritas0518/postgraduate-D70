Today is the last day to learn the basics of Java. I'm about to enter the JDBC stage. I hope I can finish both before the end of this summer vacation, and then get a little introduction to Java Web, but I still feel a little difficult. The Internet is really wonderful. Here you can really see that there are all kinds of people in the world. There is really no relationship between quality and education. What I say most is that China is one of the countries with the most serious internal problems, because the Chinese people's ugly inferiority makes people have to be involved. Is this the so-called socialism? Ridiculous
